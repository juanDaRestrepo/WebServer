# ProjectÂ´s description:

This a webServer deploy in heroku to serve any frontend app.

## Tools used:

* Handlebars: Handlebars.js and Mustache are both logicless templating languages that keep the view and the code separated like we all know they should be.

* Express: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

* Nodemon: nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected

* Dotenv: Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.
